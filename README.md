# tonediff

A friend told me to make a site like this after an existing site went down due to flash player support ending. 
The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for musicians to flex on each other about how sensitive their ears are to minor pitch variations.

tonediff-page contains source code for a website currently published at <https://tone-diff.surge.sh/>. The files outside of that directory were used for prototyping.
